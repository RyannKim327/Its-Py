It explores seven themes:the meaning and context of plagiarism, the nature of plagiarism by students, how dostudents perceive plagiarism, how big a problem is student plagiarism, why do studentscheat, what challenges are posed by digital plagiarism and is there a need to promoteacademic integrity? It is concluded that plagiarism is doubtless common and gettingmore so (particularly with increased access to digital sources, including the Internet),that there are multiple reasons why students plagiarise and that students often rational-ise their cheating behaviour and downplay the importance of plagiarism by themselvesand their peers. It is also concluded that there is a growing need for UK institutions todevelop cohesive frameworks for dealing with student plagiarism that are based onprevention supported by robust detection and penalty systems that are transparent andapplied consistently. Introduction Much has been written on the theme of plagiarism by students, particularly in the context of North American experience. This paper reviews that literature in order to discoverwhat lessons it holds for institutional policy and practice within institutions of highereducation in the UK. As well as being \u2018the problem that won\u2019t go away\u2019 (Paldy, 1996), plagiarism is a problem that is growing bigger. There is mounting evidence that student cheating ingeneral, and plagiarism in particular, are becoming more common and more widespread,encouraging Alschuler and Blimling (1995) to speak of \u2018epidemic cheating\u2019. Thisevidence is multi-dimensional, coming from many countries, including the USA (White,1993), the UK (Ashworth & Bannister, 1997), Southern Africa (Weeks, 2001) and and ISSN 0260-2938 print; ISSN 1469-297X online/03/050471-18 \uf6d92003 Taylor & Francis Ltd DOI: 10.1080/0260293032000120352472 C. Park Finland (Seppanen, 2002), embracing both undergraduate and postgraduate students and including public and private higher institutions of education, large and small. The emphasis in this paper is on the causes and consequences of student plagiarism. Whilst the paper also addresses some aspects of designing appropriate coping strategiesfor dealing with them, this is very much a secondary theme here. It is, therefore, not byaccident that the focus is primarily on the student perspective and experience. This is notto deny the important role played by academic staff and the relevance of particularacademic traditions, for example in setting particular types of assignment which mightbe easier to plagiarise or where the temptations to plagiarise might be stronger or inprivileging the ability to reproduce existing knowledge above originality in studentwriting, which merit detailed treatment elsewhere. The paper is in seven sections, which deal in turn with the meaning and context of plagiarism, the nature of plagiarism by students, how do students perceive plagiarism,how big a problem is student plagiarism, why do students cheat and what challenges areposed by digital plagiarism. The paper rounds off by looking at the need to promoteacademic integrity. Plagiarism: Context De\ufb01nitionAccording to the Collins Dictionary of the English Language (Hanks, 1979), plagiarism is \u2018the act of plagiarising\u2019, which means \u2018to appropriate (ideas, passages, etc) from (another work or author)\u2019. Plagiarism involves literary theft, stealing (by copying) thewords or ideas of someone else and passing them off as one\u2019s own without crediting thesource. Barnhart (1988, p. 801) traces the etymology of the word plagiarism (\u2018literary theft\u2019), from the earlier English word plagiary (\u2018one who wrongfully takes another\u2019s words orideas\u2019), derived from the Latin plagarius (\u2018kidnapper, seducer, plunderer, literary thief\u2019), from plagium (kidnapping) from plaga (snare, net). The term plagiarism is usually used to refer to the theft of words or ideas, beyond what would normally be regarded as general knowledge. This is the spirit of thede\ufb01nition of plagiarism adopted by the Association of American Historians, whodescribe it as \u2018the misuse of the writings of another author \u2026 including the limitedborrowing, without attribution, of another\u2019s distinctive and signi\ufb01cant research \ufb01ndings,hypotheses, theories \u2026 or interpretations\u2019 (Fialkoff, 1993). Rhetoric The rhetoric of plagiarism is nothing if not colourful. Some writers describe plagiarism in moralistic tones, for example as \u2018the unoriginal sin\u2019 (Colon, 2001), \u2018sin \u2026 againstoriginality\u2019 (Anonymous, 1997) and \u2018a writer\u2019s worst sin\u2019 (Miller, 1993). It has also beencriticised as \u2018an attack on \u2026 nothing less than a basic human right, to property, toidentity\u2019 (Freedman, 1994) and a \u2018cancer that erodes the rich legacy of scholarship\u2019(Zangrando, 1991/2). Some writers prefer more legalistic language. The US Of\ufb01ce ofResearch Integrity (ORI), for example, views plagiarism as \u2018the theft or misappropriationof intellectual property (Anonymous, 1995). The plagiarist has been described as a\u2018thought thief\u2019 (Whiteneck, 2002) or \u2018intellectual shoplifter\u2019 (Stebelman, 1998), chargedPlagiarism Literature and Lessons 473 with having committed \u2018forgery\u2019 (Groom, 2000), \u2018theft of ideas\u2019 (Hopkin, 1993) and a \u2018crime\u2019 (Franke, 1993). Whilst many regard plagiarism as malpractice, others view it as poor practice. Thus, for example, it has been dismissed as a \u2018slip in scholarship\u2019 (Leatherman, 1999) and\u2018poor scholarship\u2019 (Fialkoff, 2002), a question of \u2018academic etiquette and polite behav-iour \u2026 [rather than a form of] intellectual theft\u2019 (Ashworth & Bannister, 1997), \u2018a lapserather than a crime\u2019 (Gray, 2002). More bluntly, it has been described as \u2018a disease ofinarticulateness\u2019 (Bowers, 1994) and a form of mental illness (Howard, 2000). Origin and Emergence Plagiarism is not a new phenomenon. Copying from other writers is probably as old as writing itself, but until the advent of mass-produced writing, it remained hidden from thepublic gaze. According to Mallon (1989), the Elizabethan playwright Ben Johnson was the \ufb01rst person to use the word plagiary to mean literary theft, at the beginning of the 17thcentury. Then, it was not uncommon for a writer to borrow work from other writers.What Thomas (2000) calls \u2018textual misappropriations\u2019 became much more common asmass-produced books became more widely available and there was more material tosteal from. Even Shakespeare appears to have both copied (Julius, 1998) and been copied(Thomas, 2000). Before copyright laws it was dif\ufb01cult for writers to establish let aloneprotect authorship, but by the mid 18th century plagiarism was more clearly de\ufb01ned bycopyright laws and plagiarists were confronted with changing public attitudes towardsliterary property and strong moral views of literary theft (Goldgar, 2001). The Westernliterary tradition connects authorship with ownership, but Bowden (1996) argues thatsuch a notion is challenged by the rise of plagiarism in the post-modern literary era.Inevitably, opportunities to plagiarise the work of others have expanded greatly since theadvent and increased accessibility of the Internet. Like many things, plagiarism is seen differently when viewed through different lenses. Now widely considered a vice, in days past it was sometimes considered a virtue,imitation being considered the highest form of \ufb02attery. This same tension still holds truetoday in some non-Western cultures, and it must be taken into account when dealingappropriately with plagiarism by students from different cultural backgrounds, groundedin different notions of respect for authority and different traditions of academic writing. Beyond the Academy Students have no monopoly on plagiarism as a form of dishonest behaviour. What Straw (2002) calls \u2018the P-word\u2019 is common in many \ufb01elds, including journalism (Lieberman,1995), politics (Perin, 1992) and science (Vandervoort, 1995). Suspicions, allegationsand (where available) proof of plagiarism by public \ufb01gures, and the fall from grace thatoften follows, regularly make headline news. Recent high pro\ufb01le examples includehistory writer Stephen E. Ambrose, Kennedy biographer Doris Kearns Goodwin(Fitzgerald, 2002) and David Robinson, the former Vice Chancellor of Monash Univer-sity in Australia (Baty, 2002). Many well-known authors have been accused of plagiarism, including William Shakespeare (Julius, 1998), Mark Twain (Kruse, 1990), George Orwell (Rose, 1992),Alex Haley (Taylor, 1995), Samuel Beckett (Acheson, 1978) and Edgar Allen Poe(McMullen, 1995). Song writers including Celine Dion (LeBlanc, 1997) and Michael474 C. Park Jackson (Dezzani, 1999) and \ufb01lm directors such as Steven Spielberg (Kessler, 1998; Zeitchik, 1998) have faced plagiarism charges in court. Others accused of plagiarisminclude the scientists Pythagoras (Maddox, 1995) and Einstein (Broad, 1997), thephilosophers Descartes (Smith, 1998), Sartre (Gottlieb, 1994) and Wittgenstein(Goldstein, 1999; Cohen, 2001) and churchmen John Wesley (Abelove, 1996) andMartin Luther King Jr (Carson & Holloran, 1991; Luker, 1993). Against this background of plagiarism as a long-established practice evidenced in many different areas of activity, plagiarism by students sits as a special problem withinhigher education. Many causes and practices of plagiarism from \u2018beyond the academy\u2019cross over into the world of student writing, although there are additional drivers ofplagiarism by students (see \u2018Why do students cheat?\u2019 below). Plagiarism by Students The core business of the knowledge industry is handling information and ideas from different sources, so there is inevitably great scope for plagiarism within the academicworld. Here plagiarism occurs in a variety of settings, including collaboration orcooperation between students working together (Wojtas, 1999), unattributed use of otherpeople\u2019s writings by undergraduates (Ashworth & Bannister, 1997), Master\u2019s students(Baty, 2001) and PhD students (Morgan & Thomson, 1997), copying of graduatestudents\u2019 work by supervisors or other members of academic staff (Smith, I., 1995;Macilwain, 1998) and taking credit in research grant applications for work done bysomeone else (Stone, 1996). Types of Cheating There is an extensive literature on the theme of plagiarism within higher education, particularly in North America and particularly by students (see for example Carmack,1983; Brown, V. J. & Howell, 2001; Landau et al ., 2002). But plagiarism per se must be viewed as part of the broader problem of cheating (Leming, 1980; Barnett & Dalton,1981; Raffetto, 1985, Haines et al ., 1986; Roberts, R. N., 1986; Deikhof et al ., 1999; McCabe, 2001). Observers have situated plagiarism in different ways, as a matter ofacademic misconduct (Stern & Havlicek, 1986), academic dishonesty (Hardy, 1981/2;Singhal & Johnson, 1983; Carmack, 1983; Reams, 1987; Hollinger & Lanza-Kaduce,1996; Caruana et al., 2000; Higbee & Thomas, 2000) or academic integrity (Nuss, 1984; Iovacchini et al ., 1989; Cole & Conklin, 1996; Cole & McCabe, 1996). To some it is simply a matter of unethical behaviour (Anderson & Obenshain, 1994; Buckley et al ., 1998). Studies of academic dishonesty amongst students have often focused on the types of behaviours and practices they are likely to engage in, including cheating on tests andassignments, falsi\ufb01cation of data, plagiarism, inappropriate use of resources, takingcredit for work done by others and manipulation of academic staff (Raffetto, 1985;Saunders, 1993; Ferrell & Daniel, 1995; Baldwin et al ., 1998). Sims (1993) has shown how students who cheat often persist in cheating throughout their subsequent career. Plagiarism by students is a moral maze, because it raises important ethical and moral questions about good/bad or right/wrong behaviour and about acceptable/unacceptablepractices. Who decides it is wrong, on what basis and for what reasons? Who isresponsible for deciding on behavioural norms in the context of plagiarism? (Hopkin,1993). Should universities seek to teach students about values, moral leadership andPlagiarism Literature and Lessons 475 personal ethics and, if so, why and how? (Cole & Conklin, 1996). The challenge for institutions is how best to deal with what Stahl (2002) calls \u2018the no-fear generation\u2019 andStraw (2002) refers to as \u2018generation \u2018why-not\u201d, who believe that the older generationis \u2018clueless\u2019 and that copying material from the Internet is \u2018fair game\u2019. Plagiarism is also a legal mine\ufb01eld because, although \u2018plagiarism isn\u2019t a legal term\u2019 (Fialkoff, 1993), legal cases involving plagiarism have ended up in court in the USA,and these have tended to focus \u2018on the role of intent, procedural rights and therelationship between plagiarism and copyright\u2019 (Saunders, 1993). Brandt (2002) stressesthat \u2018copyright abuse and plagiarism are like two sides of a permission coin: on the oneside, people take without asking, and on the other side, people take without telling.\u2019 Forms of Plagiarism by Students Students plagiarise in four main ways (Wilhoit, 1994; Brandt, 2002; Howard, 2002).1. Stealing material from another source and passing it off as their own, e.g. (a) buying a paper from a research service, essay bank or term paper mill (either pre-written or specially written), (b) copying a whole paper from a source text without proper acknowledgement,(c) submitting another student\u2019s work, with or without that student\u2019s knowledge (e.g. by copying a computer disk). 2. Submitting a paper written by someone else (e.g. a peer or relative) and passing it off as their own. 3. Copying sections of material from one or more source texts, supplying proper documentation (including the full reference) but leaving out quotation marks, thusgiving the impression that the material has been paraphrased rather than directlyquoted. 4. Paraphrasing material from one or more source texts without supplying appropriate documentation. Whilst the word \u2018plagiarism\u2019 is not itself ambiguous, a number of complications arise as soon as it is applied to an academic setting because \u2018between imitation and theft,between borrowing and plagiarism, lies a wide, murky borderland\u2019 (Anonymous, 1997).One is the problem of distinguishing degrees of plagiarism, because it covers a spectrumof situations, ranging, as Wilhoit (1994) puts it, \u2018from sloppy documentation andproof-reading to outright, premeditated fraud. Few other terms that we commonly use inour classes have such widely differing meanings\u2019. Given that \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 is theultimate objective, how do students learn what is acceptable practice, particularly at thelower end of the spectrum? Secondly, how much does an original text need to be alteredto avoid the charge of plagiarism? Roig (2001) points out that most students strugglewith distinguishing between paraphrasing (which \u2018involves restating text from anoriginal source in the writer\u2019s own words\u2019) and summarising (which \u2018condenses largeamounts of text into a few sentences for the purpose of conveying the main points of theoriginal\u2019). Athird dif\ufb01culty is that whilst most authorities agree that plagiarism covers the copying of ideas as well as words, ideas are often \ufb02uid and evolve through time and itis not always easy to trace and attribute the originator of ideas. White (1993) contendsthat students need to learn that sources should support, not substitute for, their own ideas.There is also uncertainty about \u2018the point at which an idea passes into general knowledgein a way that no longer requires attribution\u2019 (Leatherman, 1999). Most writers agree that476 C. Park matters of common knowledge do not need referencing in academic writing, but what precisely is \u2018common knowledge\u2019, and who de\ufb01nes it? Motive and Intent Some students plagiarise on purpose, knowingly. Intentional plagiarism is intentional if it is pre-meditated, designed to deceive and thus a deliberate act of literary theft. Whilstintentionality might be dif\ufb01cult to establish or prove, there is no doubt that someplagiarism is accidental or inadvertent. Such unintentional plagiarism occurs when astudent fails to adopt (perhaps because they do not know) proper protocols for referringto academic material, including appropriate ways of quoting, acknowledging ideas andcompiling reference lists (Mills, 1994). In cases like this there is no ultimate intent todeliberately deceive, and the literary theft is accidental (Colon, 2001). Unintentional plagiarism can be caused by what psychologists describe as cryptomne- sia or \u2018hidden memory\u2019 (Brown & Halliday, 1991; Marsh & Landau, 1995), which is \u2018anintriguing type of mental illusion in which people mistakenly believe that they haveproduced a new idea when in fact they have simply unwittingly retrieved an old,previously encountered idea from memory\u2019 (Macrae et al., 1999). For example, Acheson (1978) describes Samuel Beckett\u2019s \u2018instances of involuntary memory\u2019 and his failure toinclude footnoted acknowledgements in some essays. Experimental studies have shownhow implicit memories of previously seen material can inadvertently lead to repetition(Penpenny & Keriazokas, 1998), how such errors might be avoided (Marsh & Landau1997) and how this unconscious recall is stronger with more credible sources (Bink et al., 1999). The literature contains mixed messages about how serious a problem unintentional plagiarism is. Bugeja (2001) points out that \u2018a student who honestly did not intend toplagiarise may still be held legally liable \u2026 . But, from an ethical perspective \u2026 absenceof intent is a mitigating factor\u2019. However, Fialkoff (1993) insists that \u2018there\u2019s no excusefor plagiarism\u2019 and Perin (1992) argues that \u2018carelessness is almost as great a sin inwriters as deceit\u2019. How do Students Perceive Plagiarism? Results from surveys of student attitudes and perceptions are often quite contradictory; some studies (for example Sutton & Huba, 1995) \ufb01nd broad agreement amongst studentsabout what kinds of behaviour constitute cheating, whilst others describe great variabilityin student perceptions about cheating in general (Barnett & Dalton, 1981) and aboutplagiarism in particular (Overbey & Guiling, 1999). As Roberts and Rabinowitz (1992)point out, student perceptions of cheating situations are contingent upon the interplay ofmultiple factors such as need, provocation, opportunity and intentionality. Nonethelesssome broad patterns are apparent in the literature. First, many students generally regard plagiarism as \u2018no big deal\u2019. Payne and Nantz (1994) found that \u2018according to many students, there is a signi\ufb01cant difference betweencheating on exams (\u2018blatant\u2019 cheating) and other forms of academic cheating (oftenviewed as less serious or \u2018not really\u2019 cheating.)\u2019. In the overall scheme of things,students often view plagiarism as a relatively minor offence, although Ashworth et al. (1997) found a strong moral basis for UK student perceptions of cheating, focusing onvalues such as friendship, trust and good learning. Sutton and Huba (1995) explored theimpact on North American students\u2019 perceptions of academic dishonesty of racePlagiarism Literature and Lessons 477 (African-American and white students had different perceptions) and religiosity (percep- tions depended partly on students\u2019 level of participation in religious activities). Studentsoften do not see cheating as a major problem among their peers (Daniel et al ., 1991). For example, a study by Lim and See (2001) based in Singapore, which they describeas \u2018one of the most competitive educational systems in the world\u2019, found that students\u2018are morally ambivalent about academic cheating and are rather tolerant of dishonestyamong their peers. On the issue of whether cheating behaviours should be reported \u2026 amajority of students chose to take the expedient measure of ignoring the problem ratherthan to blow the whistle on their peers\u2019. Secondly, many studies have shown that academic staff and students have very different attitudes towards cheating and plagiarism (Stern & Havlicek, 1986; Anderson&Obershain, 1994; Roth & McCabe, 1995; Higbee & Thomas, 2000). Evans & Craig (1990) uncovered general agreement between high school students and staff that cheatingis a serious problem, but major differences in views regarding scale and criteria, causesand effective approaches to prevention. Academic staff views on plagiarism appear tovary between disciplines (Roig, 2001). Although staff generally consider speci\ufb01cdishonest behaviours as more serious than do students, there is evidence that thedifferences decrease as students progress towards graduation (Sims, 1995). Ashworthand Bannister (1997) argue that, in the UK \u2018in general, plagiarism is a far lessmeaningful concept for students than it is for academic staff, and it ranks relatively lowin the student system of values\u2019. Social Construction Payne and Nantz (1994) explore social accounts and metaphors of cheating amongst students and they conclude that students\u2019 academic behaviour is socially constructed andlegitimated. This helps to explain why cheating and attitudes to it vary so much withinand between different groups of students and between students and staff. Framingplagiarism as a social construct is a useful way of reconciling differences in studentviews, attitudes and practices relating to cheating between western and Oriental countries(Lim & See, 2001). It also underlines the essentially socially situated nature of writing,which allows students, \u2018through interaction with more experienced peers and instructors,\u2026[to] negotiate and de-construct their notions of plagiarism\u2019 (Evans & Youmans, 2000). How Big a Problem is Student Plagiarism? The available statistics don\u2019t paint a very consistent picture about the scale and nature of the plagiarism problem, the extent to which it is changing through time or varies fromcountry to country, from subject to subject or between undergraduates and graduatestudents. Comparative data are dif\ufb01cult to \ufb01nd, for two main reasons. First, studies differ in focus; some examine cheating in general, others focus speci\ufb01cally on plagiarism.Secondly, there are differences in sources of information; some studies (for exampleMichaels & Miethe, 1989) are based on self-reporting by students, whilst others quotedetection rates by staff (which is likely to be \u2018the tip of the iceberg\u2019, because mostplagiarism probably goes undetected). Even the self-reporting category is open toambiguity and inconsistency, and Karlins et al.(1988) stress the need to investigate what students do rather than what they say they do in the context of academic dishonesty,478 C. Park because there are often major differences between the two. Caruana et al .(2000) developed and tested a measure of academic dishonesty and found it reliable and validfor measuring actual cheating and plagiarism by students. However, there is no doubtthat more research needs to be done in this area. Incidence The reported incidence of cheating varies a great deal from study to study. At the lowest end of the spectrum, Karlins et al .(1988) found that only 3% of the students on a business course plagiarised a library research assignment. More common are reportedincidence levels of at least 50%. For example, Haines et al.(1986) found that more than half of the 380 students they interviewed self-reported cheating during the academic yearin at least one area (exams, quizzes, homework assignments). In a study by Hollingerand Lanza-Kaduce (1996) more than two-thirds self-reported some form of academiccheating during a sample semester. Some studies report incidence levels of three-quartersor more. Eighty per cent of the graduate business students interviewed by Brown (1995)had engaged in at least one form of cheating, including plagiarism. Stern and Havlicek(1986) found that 82% of the 314 undergraduate students in their survey admitted toengaging in some form of academic misconduct during their college careers. Trends and Patterns Although the number of studies is small, there is evidence of patterns of variations in the incidence of cheating by students. 1. Variations between disciplines. Meade (1992) asked 6000 students at 31 top-ranked US universities if they had cheated during their college career. Cheating was mostcommonly reported by students in business studies, ranked highest (87%), followedby engineering (74%), science (67%) and humanities (63%). 2. Variations between countries, Diekhoff et al .(1999) found similarities and differ- ences in attitudes and behaviours between American and Japanese college students.Lupton et al .(2000) found signi\ufb01cant differences in behaviour and beliefs about cheating between US and Polish business students; 84% of the latter reported havingcheated, compared with 55% of the former. 3. Variations between undergraduate and graduate students. Few studies have explored this, but Brown (1995) found that despite their self-perception as more ethical thanundergraduates, graduate business students had a similar frequency of unethicalbehaviour compared with undergraduates in other studies. 4. Variations through time. Longitudinal and time series data on student cheating are thin on the ground, but the evidence suggests that it is becoming more common. Forexample, McCabe and Bowers (1994) discovered a dramatic increase in self-reportedcheating among male undergraduate college students between 1963 and 1991 andDiekhoff et al .(1996) found a signi\ufb01cant rise in cheating by US college students between 1984 and 1994. Many observers believe that the incidence of plagiarism inthe UK is on the rise, driven by ease of access to digital sources of information(particularly the Internet) (Baty, 2000) and by the relentless pressures of massparticipation and declining contact between students and staff (Ashworth & Bannis-ter, 1997).Plagiarism Literature and Lessons 479 Why do Students Cheat? Educators need to recognise the causes of plagiarism in order to address them, as Weeks (2001) stresses. But the situation is often complex and multi-dimensional, with no simplecause\u2013effect link. For example, Michaels and Miethe (1989) situate academic cheatingwithin social psychological theories of deviance and Lieberman (1995) argues thatplagiarism resembles kleptomania \u2018in that the stolen passages may not be needed and theperson taking them has a wish to be caught\u2019. Groom (2000) suggests that the act offorgery and fakery has inherent appeal to students. There might be large-scale processesat work, too, because as society in general become more competitive and as fraudulentbehaviour is uncovered and exposed elsewhere, often on a huge scale, such as the majorEnron \ufb01nancial scandal of 2002, student sensitivity towards cheating, and the propensityto take risks, may well be changing. Asimple typology of reasons why students plagiarise, informed particularly by the work of Stevens and Stevens (1987), Davis et al.(1992), Love and Simmons (1998) and Straw (2002), captures the multiple and contingent motives of plagiarism by students. 1. Genuine lack of understanding. Some students plagiarise unintentionally, when they are not familiar with proper ways of quoting, paraphrasing, citing and referencingand/or when they are unclear about the meaning of \u2018common knowledge\u2019 and theexpression \u2018in their own words\u2019. 2. Ef\ufb01ciency gain. Students plagiarise to get a better grade and to save time. Some cheat because of what Straw (2002) calls \u2018the GPA thing\u2019, so that cheating becomes \u2018theprice of an A\u2019 (Whiteman & Gordon, 2001). Auer & Krupar (2001) identify a strongconsumer mentality amongst students, who seem to believe that \u2018they should getgrades based on effort rather than on achievement\u2019. 3. Time management. There are many calls on student\u2019s time, including peer pressure for an active social life, commitment to college sports and performance activities,family responsibilities and pressure to complete multiple work assignments in shortamounts of time. Little wonder that Silverman (2002) concludes that \u2018students\u2019overtaxed lives leave them so vulnerable to the temptations of cheating\u2019. 4. Personal values/attitudes. Some student see no reason why they should not plagiarise or do it because of social pressure, because it makes them feel good or because theyregard short cuts as clever and acceptable 5. De\ufb01ance. To some students plagiarism is a tangible way of showing dissent and expressing a lack of respect for authority. They may also regard the task set as neitherimportant nor challenging 6. Students\u2019 attitudes towards teachers and class. Some students cheat because they have negative student attitudes towards assignments and tasks that teachers think havemeaning but they don\u2019t (Howard, 2002). Burnett (2002) emphasises the importanceof a relationship of trust between student and teacher, because \u2018the classes in which[students] are more likely to cheat \u2026 are those where students believe their professordoesn\u2019t bother to read their papers or closely review their work\u2019. 7. Denial or neutralisation. Some students deny to themselves that they are cheating or \ufb01nd ways of legitimising it by passing the blame on to others 8. Temptation and opportunity. It is both easier and more tempting for students to plagiarise as information becomes more accessible on the Internet and web searchtools make it easier and quicker to \ufb01nd and copy 9. Lack of deterrence. To some students the bene\ufb01ts of plagiarising outweigh the risks,480 C. Park particularly if they think there is little or no chance of getting caught and there is little or no punishment if they are caught (Davis & Ludvigson, 1995) Which Students Cheat (Most)? There is no doubt that some students cheat more than others. One group of students who regularly feature on the \u2018at risk\u2019 list is international students for whom English is nottheir \ufb01rst language and who, as Deckert (1993) points out, \u2018in settings of highereducation are frequently viewed by Western instructors as persistent plagiarizers.\u2019 Aswell as coping with language dif\ufb01culties, these students often have different attitudestowards academic authority and deference, come from cultures with radically differentattitudes to academic plagiarism and arrive with less well-developed study skills(including note taking, essay writing and bibliography construction skills) (Burnett,2002). Beyond this broad group there is less consensus, partly because of the complexinterplay of variables, including students\u2019 beliefs and values, personality, stress, socialgroups and peer pressure, classroom environment and contextual and situational factors(Barnett & Dalton, 1981; Roth & McCabe, 1995; McCabe & Trevino, 1997; Pulvers &Diekhoff, 1999; Gerdeman, 2000). Determinants Although there is ongoing debate about whether (Ferrell & Daniel, 1995) or not (Brown, 1995) students who engage in cheating behaviour share common characteristics, theevidence suggests that some factors might be particularly helpful in predicting orexplaining cheating behaviour by students. 1. Gender. Cheating tends to be more common among male than among female students (Calabrese & Cochran, 1990; Buckley et al ., 1998; Straw, 2002). 2. Age and maturity. Young (Straw, 2002) and immature (Haines et al ., 1986) students tend to cheat more often than older and more mature students. 3. Academic ability. Some studies (for example Straw, 2002) have shown that cheating is more common among students with lower GPAs than among those with highergrades, but others (for example Leming, 1980) have found no such pattern 4. Student social life. Cheating is more common amongst students who party a lot and have very active social lives (Straw, 2002), students involved in several outsideactivities (Straw, 2002) and students who are members of campus fraternities andsororities (McCabe & Bowers, 1996). 5. Peer disapproval. Peer disapproval is often only a minor in\ufb02uence on cheating by students (Diekhoff et al., 1996), although it may be stronger in institutions with honor codes (McCabe & Trevino, 1997). 6. Student personality factors. Students tend to cheat more often if they lack con\ufb01dence, feel under pressure from and seek the approval of parents and peers (Raffetto, 1985),if they have an aggressive (Type A) behaviour type (Buckley et al ., 1998), if they lack commitment to their studies (Haines et al ., 1986), if they have a neutralising (rationalising) attitude (Daniel et al ., 1994) and/or they feel alienated at college (Calabrese & Cochran, 1990). 7. Student attitude towards their classes. Cheating tends to be more common in classes where the subject matter seems to students unimportant or uninteresting or where theteacher seemed disinterested or permissive (Gerdeman, 2000).Plagiarism Literature and Lessons 481 8. Risk of being caught. A number of studies have underlined the importance, in students\u2019 decision making about cheating, of their perception of the probability andconsequences of being caught (Leming, 1980; McCabe & Trevino, 1993, 1997;Buckley et al., 1998) and of the importance of deterrents such as embarrassment and fear of punishment (Diekhoff et al ., 1996). Digital Plagiarism Recent years have witnessed the emergence and proliferation of a new form of plagiarism, from digital sources, which offers new opportunities and ease of access andwhich poses particular challenges across the whole education sector globally. Studentsnow have ready access to a huge variety of digital sources, including full-text CD-ROMdatabases and electronic journals on the Internet (Ashworth & Bannister, 1997), most ofwhich are rapidly accessible 24 hours a day 7 days a week and can be downloaded fromthe safety and comfort of their own rooms. Material on the Internet is particularlyaccessible via effective search engines such as Google.com (Lathrop & Foss, 2000;Laird, 2001), which is why UK universities are taking steps to cope with the expectedrise in the incidence of student plagiarism (Baty, 2000). The Internet The Internet provides unparalleled temptation and almost unrestricted opportunities for students to cheat by engaging in what has variously been described as \u2018cybercheating\u2019(Stebelman, 1998), \u2018cyberplagiarism\u2019 (Anderson, 1999), \u2018mouse click plagiarism\u2019 (Auer&Krupar, 2001) and \u2018academic cyber-sloth\u2019 (Carnie, 2001). Laird (2001) has suggested that \u2018Internet plagiarism may be gathering suf\ufb01cient force to become an academichurricane\u2019. One of the major problems confronting universities is to persuade students that such material is not \u2018free for the taking\u2019 (Colon, 2001; Whiteneck, 2002) in the same way thatartists can freely collect and use \u2018found objects\u2019. Attitudes towards ownership of materialon the web is a major challenge, because today\u2019s students \u2018have become so accustomedto downloading music and reading articles free on the Internet that they see it asacceptable to incorporate passages into their papers without attribution as well\u2019 (Young,2001). Kellogg (2002) warns that \u2018the problem is likely to get worse as more and morestudents reared on the Internet enter college\u2019. It\u2019s not all bad news because, as Carnie (2001) points out, \u2018the Web is a fabulous resource that no student or scholar can ignore. Somehow, though, we have to convincepeople that learning requires more than high-speed connections and a good searchengine\u2019. Term Paper Mills Agrowing challenge for universities everywhere is the proliferation of online term paper mills (Anderson, 1999), through which \u2018a student can simply log onto the Internet andbuy a paper with a click and a credit card\u2019 (Whiteneck, 2002). Groark et al.(2001) point out that paper mills existed long before the Internet, although \u2018with the advent of Internettechnology \u2026 the number of places where papers are available has grown and the easewith which papers can be obtained has increased\u2019.482 C. Park Paper mills, such as www.cheathouse.com and www.schoolsucks.com, sell pre-pre- pared essays and papers over the Internet (Furedi, 2000), as an enterprising form ofacademic \u2018outsourcing\u2019 (Anonymous, 2002), or what Silverman (2002) describes as\u2018paper pilfering\u2019. Some sites allow free downloads while others charge, including anextra fee for immediate E-mail delivery (Stebelman, 1998). Some will write a cus-tomised paper, using an online ghost-writer who will produce a custom-written paper onany particular topic, within an agreed time frame, for an agreed fee (Howard, 2002). OneNorth American web site (www.ivyessays.com) even sells successful college admissionessays to students. Digital Detection Digital plagiarism is a double-edged sword for students, because whilst it allows them to \ufb01nd and copy material at will, the same technology allows staff to detect plagiarismby comparing versions of text (including comparing a student\u2019s text with massivedatabases which cover much of the Internet). Web search engines (likewww.Google.com) allow staff to search the Internet for web sites containing strings ofwords, if they suspect that parts of a student\u2019s assignment have been plagiarised from theInternet. In this sense \u2018the Internet may make it easier to copy, but it also makes it easierto expose the copier\u2019 (Colon, 2001). Fialkoff (2002) concludes that \u2019 it is clear thattechnology has made the practice of good scholarship more complex, even if theprinciples remain the same. \u2026 The computer, and the net, may be both a curse and ablessing when it comes to writing \u2026\u2019. Promoting Academic Integrity Surveys of student cheating in North American universities during the 1990s showed that \u2018students don\u2019t think cheating is a big deal and professors [academic staff] are doinglittle to curb it\u2019 (Wilson, 1999). In response to this challenge, many institutions adoptedformal honor codes, designed to appeal to students\u2019 sense of ethics and to emphasisesuch values as truth, accountability and social responsibility (Bugeja, 2001). Underlyingthis movement has been a desire to foster what McCabe and Trevino (2002) describe asa\u2018culture of integrity\u2019, aimed at reducing student cheating but also at foregrounding \u2018the value of living in a community of trust\u2019. Honor Codes Uptake of the honor code idea was initially slow; by 1994 only about a quarter of the colleges and universities in North America had introduced them (Kibler, 1994). In thelate 1990s US colleges were urged to take a more proactive stance towards preventingcheating by students, and to de\ufb01ne academic integrity and stress its importance (Wilson,1999). The establishment of the Center for Academic Integrity (CAI) at Duke Universityin North Carolina was instrumental in achieving this ambition. The Center, a consortiumof more than 200 institutions of higher education in North America, promotes anapproach that emphasises the fundamental values of academic integrity (honesty, trust,fairness, respect and responsibility) (McCabe & Pavela, 1997). The CAI approach is based on advising students what academic integrity is and why it is important (thus identifying values and behaviours to be promoted, rather than listingbehaviours to be prohibited) and encouraging or requiring students to sign a pledge thatPlagiarism Literature and Lessons 483 they will uphold academic integrity and not cheat or plagiarise. Procedures vary from place to place, within the spirit of the honor code system. At some institutions, such asDuke University (Burnett, 2002) and Vanderbilt University (McCabe & Trevino, 2002),students take part in public \u2018signing ceremonies\u2019, to indicate their personal commitmentto upholding the institutional honor code. At other institutions, such as the University ofMaryland (Anonymous, 2001), students are asked to write and sign an honor pledge oneach of their assignments and exams. No matter whether, when and how often students are asked to sign an honor pledge, it is vitally important that the institution has a clear code that is distributed or readilyavailable to all students and that academic staff hold discussions with their students toestablish academic \u2018rules of engagement\u2019 and avoid misunderstandings (Burnett, 2002).Students must be made aware that academic integrity is a major institutional priority(McCabe & Trevino, 2002). North American experience also shows that honor code systems work best when students are actively engaged in the process and take part in it, if not actually assumeownership of it. Few honor code systems are entirely student managed (Paldy, 1996),and codes that require students to report instances of academic dishonesty rarely workeffectively (Jendrek, 1992). McCabe and Trevino (2002) insist that there should be\u2018student participation in campus judicial or hearing bodies that review alleged infringe-ments of the honor code \u2026 [that] students should also have a voice on task forces orcommittees charged with informing other students about the purposes and philosophy ofthe code, and they should play a major role in its development and implementation\u2019. There is ongoing debate about whether or not integrity can be taught (Vandervoort, 1995) and student attitudes towards academic integrity appear to be in\ufb02uenced bymultiple factors, including students\u2019 personal characteristics, student activities, studentattitudes and gender (Iovacchini et al ., 1989). Nonetheless, there is mounting evidence that students in institutions with academic honor codes view the issue of academicintegrity and treat cheating behaviours in very different ways to those at institutionswithout honor codes (McCabe et al ., 1999). Academic honesty is higher, and levels of self-reported cheating are lower, in institutions that have honor codes (May & Lloyd,1993; McCabe & Bowers, 1994). Conclusion There is an extensive literature on plagiarism by students, particularly in the context of North America experience, but it clearly holds important lessons for institutional policyand practice within institutions of higher education in the UK. The literature shows thatplagiarism by students is common and getting more so (particularly with increasedaccess to digital sources, including the Internet), that there are multiple reasons whystudents plagiarise and that students often rationalise their cheating behaviour anddownplay the importance of plagiarism by themselves and their peers. Whether or not the problem has reached epidemic proportions, as some observers insist, it is clearly a major problem, and one that appears to be on the increase. Thepractice of plagiarism is a major challenge to institutional aspirations of academicintegrity and a major threat to institutional quality assurance and enhancement, and itneeds to be taken into account when developing and implementing institutional learning,teaching and assessment strategies. There is a growing need for UK institutions todevelop cohesive frameworks for dealing with student plagiarism that are based on484 C.
