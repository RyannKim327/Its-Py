#### Ryann Kim Sesgundo

### Packages
1. Tkinter
2. Json
3. PyPDF2 > `pip install PyPDF2`

### Success Plans
- [x] To create a simple Document Management System
- [x]. As an Operating System gives me an idea, I'd tried to make it responsible as I can
- [x]]. To store all the data from PDF files
- [x]. To store all the data by copy and pasting it from document (docx) to content
- [x]. To check whether the data or string is already existed in the database (json)
- [x]. Fixed Tree (Table) for insertions
- [x]. Fixed Title
- [x]. Fixed Content clear in responsive
- [x]. Make simple Tkinter Widget Modifications
- [x]. Can check whether the data is existed to avoid doubling the content.

### Ideas and Inspration
> As I saw the User Interface of an Operating System, it comes the idea that I also want to do a responsive design with `Tkinter`. The first project I've implemented was Grade Management and Monitoring System, but I've changed it because I'm not satisfied on it becausse we have already an activity, related to this, so I tried to look for more ideas until I saw a Document in my files, so I've planned to use `Document Management System`. I've also planned to add anti plagiarism checker, but I've removed it due to lack of time to take some study about it. The main idea here is just to save the Document as text into the JSON database, which they may still look for the data if it using the scroll text it maybe `Text` Widget of tkinter. As of `February 23, 2024`, the development is still in the range of 75%, which has primary options which incliudes `Create` and `Read` and `Update` (by appending) the data. For now, I'm thinking if I use archive or delete function for the document, for the data deprication. As od `February 24, 2024` while writing this document, I'm still planning more although its already due, but still trying to fix and figure more about this.
