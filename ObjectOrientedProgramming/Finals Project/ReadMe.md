#### Ryann Kim Sesgundo

### Packages
1. Tkinter
2. Json
3. PyPDF2 > `pip install PyPDF2`

### Plans
1. To create a simple Document Management System
2. As an Operating System gives me an idea, I'd tried to make it responsible as I can
3. To store all the data from PDF files
4. To store all the data by copy and pasting it from document (docx) to content
5. To check whether the data or string is already existed in the database (json)
